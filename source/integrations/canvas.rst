Canvas Integration
******************

.. warning::
    This integration serves as an early concept / beta for this workflow. Work will continue on adding additional features and improving workflow.

The Canvas integration is composed of the Kraken plug-in along with the `presetGen.py` script that allows users to supply command line arguments to specify how the build is configured and is run. The Canvas plug-in generates presets and allows users to have a full rig defined as a single compound node in the Canvas Graph.

Users can manipulate the data within the rig such as control positions and settings to drive the rig.
