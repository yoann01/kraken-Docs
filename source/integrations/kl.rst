KL Integration
**************

.. warning::
    This integration serves as an early concept / beta for this work flow. Work will continue on adding additional features and improving work flow.

The KL integration is composed of the Kraken plug-in along with the `presetGen.py` script that allows users to supply command line arguments to specify how the build is configured and is run.

The builder in this plug-in creates a KL extension that hosts a KL struct that encompasses the entire rig. This KL based rig can then be used within Canvas or other integrations where KL objects can be instanced and manipulated.
